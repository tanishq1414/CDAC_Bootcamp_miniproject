# CDAC_Bootcamp_miniproject
A self-learning AI firewall that uses dynamic IP/port changes, deception honeypots, and real-time isolation to outsmart and contain attackers.
🔥 Dynamic AI-Powered Firewall with Deception & NAT
📌 Overview

Traditional firewalls are static, predictable, and easily bypassed. Our solution introduces a dynamic, intelligent firewall that constantly adapts, learns, and deceives attackers. Instead of just blocking threats, it confuses, traps, and isolates them while keeping legitimate users safe.

This system combines AI-driven threat detection, dynamic IP/port translation (NAT), and deception honeypots to create a defense mechanism that is adaptive, proactive, and cost-effective.

✨ Key Features

🔄 Dynamic Defense – IP hopping, port rotation, and real-time rule updates.

🧠 AI-Powered Detection – ML models classify normal vs. malicious traffic.

🎭 Deception Layer – Honeypots, encrypted fake data, and traffic simulation.

🛡️ Automated Containment – Instantly isolates attackers with progressive restrictions.

🌐 Custom NAT Engine – Hides internal networks with dynamic address/port mapping.

📊 Real-Time Dashboard – Live visualization of attacks, deception activity, and system health.

🏗️ System Architecture

1. Core Firewall Engine

Manages IP hopping, port rotation, and NAT rules.

Updates dynamically using real-time intel.

2. AI/ML Threat Detection

Collects packet/log features (size, frequency, protocol anomalies).

ML models (Scikit-learn/TensorFlow) detect anomalies.

3. Deception Module

Redirects suspicious users to honeypots.

Serves encrypted fake data.

Generates noise traffic to confuse attackers.

4. Containment Layer

Instantly quarantines confirmed threats.

Zero Trust approach to prevent lateral movement.

5. Visualization Dashboard

Flask + SocketIO frontend.

Real-time attack maps, logs, and statistics.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Core: Python, Flask

Networking: Scapy, Socket programming, Eventlet

AI/ML: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

Deception: Custom honeypots, fake data generators

Visualization: Matplotlib, Tkinter, Flask-SocketIO

Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose

🚀 Usage

Monitor Real-Time Traffic → Dashboard shows incoming/outgoing packets.

AI Detection → Traffic classified as normal, suspicious, or malicious.

Deception Activated → Malicious traffic redirected to honeypots.

Containment → Attackers progressively isolated.

Logs & Reports → Compliance-friendly logs auto-generated.

📊 Expected Outcomes

✅ 70%+ reduction in attacker dwell time.

✅ 85%+ increase in attacker resource cost.

✅ Zero disruption for legitimate users.

✅ Real-time learning & adaptation from each attack.

🎯 Target Users

🏦 Financial Institutions – Secure customer transactions.

🏥 Healthcare Systems – Protect patient records.

🏛️ Government Agencies – Defend critical infrastructure.

🛒 E-Commerce Platforms – Prevent fraud & breaches.

🚀 Hackathon Differentiation

Unlike traditional firewalls, this project:

Makes attacks economically unfeasible.

Turns defense into an active, engaging process.

Uses AI for both detection and deception.

Provides real-time visual evidence of attacks.

📌 Future Enhancements

Integration with cloud-native deployments (Kubernetes).

Advanced behavioral deception techniques.

Federated learning for cross-organization threat sharing.

Blockchain-backed tamper-proof logging.

💎 The Bottom Line

We’re not just building a wall — we’re building a cyber funhouse that confuses attackers, learns from them, and keeps defenders one step ahead.

"This isn’t just cybersecurity — it’s cyber-jiu-jitsu, using the attacker’s own momentum against them." 🥋
